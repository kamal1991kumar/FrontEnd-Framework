# Demo UI Framework
Motivation behind creating Demo's very own UI framework are based on following points
- Keep a standard project structure
- Implement standard coding practices (using linting)
- Capable of multi-platform deployment
- Immune to single-page or multi-page application choice
- Easy to upgrade with newer version of core dependencies
- Works with Demo UI CLI interface to provide easy entity creation and rapid deployment
